# IRIS_Imager

IRIS Imager analyzes images of IRIS devices (Manganese, iron, or iron sulfide IRIS devices). For more information, see the User Guide MS Word document. The software is most easily run by downloading the .exe file and installing. The .exe file will install Matlab runtime 2020b and the IRIS Imager. Both can be run for free. If you have Matlab and the necessary toolboxes, you can download, run, and edit the .m file.
